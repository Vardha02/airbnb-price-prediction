# airbnb-price-prediction
Airbnb hosts often face difficulty in deciding the right price for their properties. The price of an Airbnb listing depends on many factors like location, room type, number of reviews, and availability. Setting a wrong price can either reduce bookings or cause loss of income.
Because the dataset is large and contains many variables, traditional tools are not efficient enough to analyze it. Hence, there is a need for a Big Dataâ€“based approach that can handle large data and give accurate price predictions.
This project aims to predict Airbnb listing prices using PySpark, a big data framework. By using machine learning models in PySpark, we can process large amounts of Airbnb data efficiently and predict property prices more accurately.
